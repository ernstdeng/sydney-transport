# sydney-transport

My attempt to re-create the Sydney Transport Network, starting off with Sydney Trains. Not making anything mind-blowing, just playing around with making maps in Python.

Some ideas for the future!
-
-  interactive map
- add nodes for stations
- add light rail, and metro networks later on.
